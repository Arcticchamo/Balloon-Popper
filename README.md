# Balloon-Popper

=====================Specs=====================<br>
Engine used: Unity 5.4.1<br>
Primary device: Mobile Android<br>
Interaction: Touch<br><br>

Ballon popper was a small game developed to assist with patients recovering from strokes. 
Within a group, 3 games were designed, with the main focus of pinching as the form of interaction.
Balloon popper was the game I designed and developed.<br>

The game is fully customisable with sliders being used to alter 3 specific properties, the speed of the ballons, the size and the amount that spawn over time. 
In addition, 3 presets have been made, Easy, Medium and Hard. These allow the users to choose how difficult the game gets. 
The size of each ballon dictates the distance between the 2 fingers in a pinching action, IE larger balloons required a larger pinch. 
When designing the game, the whole premise was usablility. Making sure that the users had full control over how the game ran.
